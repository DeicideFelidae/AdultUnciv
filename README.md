**Disclaimer/Important:** I orignally started making this mod for my personal entertainment and decided that I would release it to the public after realising this may be the only adult-themed mod for the game. If the devs of the game wish for me to private it I will respect their ask and do so. After reading the GitHub TOS, I'm not sure if this will get reported and removed but if it does I will not attempt to fight it. All characters in this mod are purely fictional & all represent consenting legal adults. This mod does not show or depict any exploitation or illegal sexual acts nor does it promote any. However it does depict features/laws from certain countries that may be legal within others however the laws in question are not obscene nor outrageous to the average internet user.

# Mod Page

As this title & warning suggest this is an **NSFW** mod aimed at adults for entertainment purposes. This mod is worked on by one person currently, I consent for it to be modified and used in anyway without my consent.

This mod adds drugs, and sex to Unciv in a "over-the-top" fashion that is supposed to be comedic rather than degenerate.

The **Nymphomanic Empire** is a sex-crazy empire that enjoys outlandish pleasures within their society. Their dream is to convert everyone on the planet to their ways if it means diplomatically, religiously or violently doing so.
